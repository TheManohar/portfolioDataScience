Don't let anyone say that it's just a game 
For I've seen other teams and it's never the same 
When you're born in Chicago you are blessed and you're healed 
The first time you walk into Wrigley Field Our heros wear pinstripes and heros in blue 
Give us the chance to feel like heros too 
Whether we'll win and if we should lose, 
We know someday we'll go all the way, 
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way! We are one with the Cubs, with the Cubs we're in love 
Hold our head high as the the underdogs 
We are not fairweather but farweather fans 
Like brothers in arms, in the streets and the stands Theres magic in the ivy and the old score board 
The same one I stared at as a kid keeping score 
In a world full of greed I could never want more 
Someday we'll go all the way 
Yeah, someday we'll go all the way 
Someday we'll go all the way 
Yeah, someday we'll go all the 
Someday we'll go all the way Heres to the men and the legends we've known 
Teaching us faith and giving us hope 
United we stand and united we'll fall 
Down to our knees the day we win it all Yeah Ernie Banks said Well lets play two 
Or did he mean two hundred years 
In the same ball park, our dimond, our jewel 
The home of our joy and our tears Keeping traditions and wishes made new 
The place where our Grandfathers' fathers grew 
The spiritual feeling if i ever knew 
If you aint been, I am sorry for you
