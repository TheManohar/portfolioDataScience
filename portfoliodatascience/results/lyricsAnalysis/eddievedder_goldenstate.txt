You are the hole in my head 
I am the pain in your neck 
You are the lump in my throat 
I am the aching in your heart 
We are tangled 
We are stolen 
We are living where things are hidden You are something in my eye 
And I am 
The shiver down your spine 
You are 
On the lick of my lips 
And I am 
On the tip of your tongue 
We are tangled 
We are stolen 
We are buried up to our necks in sand We are luck 
We are fate 
We are the feeling you get in the golden state 
We are love 
We are hate 
We are the feeling I get when you walk away? 
Walk away Well you are the dream in my nightmare 
I am that falling sensation 
You are 
not needles and pills 
I am 
Your hangover morning 
We are tangled 
We are stolen 
We are living where things are hidden We are luck 
We are fate 
We are the feeling you get in the golden state 
We are love 
We are hate 
We are the feeling I get when you walk away 
Walk away Walk away You are 
The hole in my head 
You are 
The pain in your neck 
You are 
The lump in my throat 
I am 
The aching in your heart
