Woohoo, woohoo. Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies 
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say 
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman 
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay He got the action, he got the motion 
Oh yeah, the boy can play 
Dedication devotion. 
He turnin' all the night time into the day The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman 
He do the song about the knife 
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life 
Yeah, he do the walk of life Here comes Johnny gonna tell you a story 
Hand me down my walkin' shoes 
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory 
Backbeat, the talkin' blues He got the action, he got the motion 
Oh yeah, the boy can play 
Dedication devotion 
He turnin' all the night time into the day The song about the sweet ole lovin' woman 
He do the song about the knife 
And he do the walk, do the walk of life 
Yeah, he do the walk of life Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies 
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say 
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman 
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay He got the action, he got the motion 
Oh yeah, the boy can play 
Dedication devotion 
He turnin' all the night time into the day 
And after all the violence and double talk 
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife 
You do the walk, do the walk of life 
Hm, you do the walk of life. 
Woohoo 
Woohoohoo
