La, la, la, la I met this girl late last year 
She said don't you worry if I disappear 
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake 
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned 
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn 
But I gave her my time for two or three nights 
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again 
She told me I was never looking for a friend 
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten 
Baby, bring the lemon & a bottle of gin 
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM 
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said 
She's singing... 
la, la, la, la 
Don't with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my own 
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la Don't with my love 
I told her, she knows 
Take aim & reload 
I don't wanna know that, babe la, la, la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her 
We drink away the days with a take away pizza 
Before a text message was the only way to reach her 
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature 
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either 
But me & her we make money the same way 
Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about 
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out 
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch 
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out 
When she was kissing him how I was confused about 
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my own 
I don't wanna know that, babe 
Don't with my love 
I told her, she knows 
Take aim & reload 
I don't wanna know that, babe On my hotel door! 
I don't even know if she knows what for 
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told you 
Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all 
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour 
We were staying on the same hotel floor 
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment 
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted 
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest 
And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my own 
I don't wanna know that, babe 
Don't with my love 
I told her, she knows 
Take aim & reload 
I don't wanna know that, babe Don't with my love 
That heart is so cold 
All over my own 
I don't wanna know that babe 
Don't with my love 
I told her, she knows 
Take aim & reload 
I don't wanna know that, babe
