I know, I know 
You belong to somebody new 
But tonight you belong to me Although, although we're apart 
You're a part of my heart 
But tonight you belong to me Way down by the stream 
How sweet it will seem 
Once more just to dream 
In the moonlight My honey, I know 
With the dawn that you will be gone 
But tonight you belong to me 
But tonight you belong to me
