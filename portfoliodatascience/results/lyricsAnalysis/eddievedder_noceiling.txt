Comes the morning when I can feel 
That there's nothing left to be concealed 
Moving on a scene surreal 
No, my heart will never, will never be far from here Sure as I'm breathing, sure as I'm sad 
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh 
I leave here believing more than I had 
And there's a reason I'll be, a reason I'll be back As I walk the hemisphere 
I got my wish to up and disappear 
I've been wounded, I've been healed 
Now for landing I've been, landing I've been cleared Sure as I'm breathing, sure as I'm sad 
I'll keep this wisdom in my flesh 
I leave here believing more than I had 
This love has got no ceiling
