There must be 
Some way out of here 
Said the joker 
To the thief 
There's too much 
Confusion 
I can't get no relief 
Businessmen 
They drink my wine 
Plowmen dig my earth 
None of them 
Along the line 
Know what 
Any of it is worth No reason 
To get excited 
The thief 
He kindly spoke 
There are 
Many here among us 
Who feel that life 
Is but a joke 
But you and I 
We've been through that 
And this is not our fate 
So let us 
Not talk falsely now 
The hour 
Is getting late All along the watchtower 
Princes kept the view 
While all the women came 
And went 
Barefoot servants, too Outside in the distance 
A wildcat did growl 
Two riders were approaching 
The wind began to howl
