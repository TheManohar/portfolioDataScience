And I wished for so long, cannot stay... 
All the precious moments, cannot stay... 
It's not like wings have fallen, cannot stay... 
But I feel something's missing, cannot say... Holding hands are daughters and sons 
And their faiths just falling down, down, down, down... 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today We all walk the long road. Cannot stay... 
There's no need to say goodbye... 
All the friends and family 
All the memories going round, round, round, round 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today And the wind keeps roaring 
And the sky keeps turning gray 
And the sun is set 
The sun will rise another day... We all walk the long road. Cannot stay... 
There's no need to say goodbye... 
All the friends and family 
All the memories going round, round, round, round 
I have wished for so long 
How I wish for you today 
How I've wished for so long 
How I wish for you today We all walk the long road 
We all walk the long road 
We all walk the long road
