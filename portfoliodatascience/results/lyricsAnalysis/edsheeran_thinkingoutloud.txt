When your legs don't work like they used to before 
And I can't sweep you off of your feet 
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love? 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? So, honey, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone, and my memory fades 
And the crowds don't remember my name 
When my hands don't play the strings the same way 
I know you will still love me the same 'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen 
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory 
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways 
And maybe it's all part of a plan 
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes 
Hoping that you'll understand That, baby, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
And maybe we found love right where we are La la la, la la la, la la la, la la la loud So, baby, now 
Take me into your loving arms 
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars 
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart 
I'm thinking out loud 
Then maybe we found love right where we are 
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are 
And we found love right where we are
